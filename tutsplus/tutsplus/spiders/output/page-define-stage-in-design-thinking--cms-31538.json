In this post, we\u2019ll dive a little deeper into what we refer to as the \u201cdefine\u201d stage in that process. Warning: it\u2019s messy! So let\u2019s first remind ourselves where it sits in the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design\u2019s proposal:", "The main concern in the \u201cdefine\u201d stage of Design Thinking is around\u00a0clearly articulating the problem you are trying to solve. Without clearly defining the problem, you will stumble in the dark and come up with solutions that don\u2019t work. Our goal should be to frame the problem correctly. By doing so, we generate a variety of questions, which in turn give us different options and ways of thinking about the problem. As a result, more solutions will open up.\u00a0", "The fundamental questions at this stage are:", "In order to answer these questions, we use the data collected by members of the team through engagement with users during the \u201cempathize\u201d stage. This data is interpreted and assigned meaning by all members of the cross-functional team.", "Interpreting and assigning meaning is concerned with knowing:", "Begin by making the data you\u2019ve collected more visual in order to identify patterns and themes.", "Unpack", "\u00a0user stories in order to allow the cross-functional team to dissect the stories and organize them into four categories. The four categories in which the user data is organized are:", "Unpacking is:\u00a0", "How exactly does one unpack findings? Do so by creating empathy maps of user experiences.", "Begin by reproducing the diagram above on a tall vertical space like a wall, whiteboard, etc. Write names of the interviewees/users on the board\u2014you can post pictures of your users under their names, with pictures of their environment if you have them.", "Under each name, put up post-its that tell the stories that you gathered during empathy interviews: what they said, how they responded, how they reacted, and their emotional responses (What did you hear? What did you feel? What did you see?).", "List their emotional responses: positive, neutral, or negative.", "Then their actions: body language offers a more reliable way of reading than the words one is saying. Body language may reveal hesitation, doubt, resistance and other behaviors that become a basis for deeper understanding of the problem. Make note of what stood out: contrasts, contradictions, tensions. What patterns emerge? What connections emerge? What themes emerge?\u00a0What are the key takeaways from each interview?\u00a0", "How do you start making connections between all the possibilities raised during the unpacking phase?", "What questions are sparked, and how do they spark possible solutions? Through discussion, reflection and synthesis, we start forming \u201chow might we?\u201d questions. These are meant to spark ideas in a radical new direction.", "What needs do you see?\u00a0", "What is the real problem?\u00a0", "At this stage, you will find yourself going out to gather more data from new and familiar users. You will bring more interview data, unpack it, and synthesize it.", "You will keep coming up with more insights, and you'll keep discovering different needs. However, you still won\u2019t know what the real problem is. So embrace ambiguity and uncertainty.", "Allow for the problem to germinate. It\u2019s an organic process. You will eventually arrive at what the real problem is. Do\u00a0not impose your own shortcut answer.", "Analysis", "\u00a0is about breaking down complex concepts and problems into smaller, easier-to-understand constituents.\u00a0", "Synthesis", ", on the other hand, involves creatively piecing the puzzle together to form whole ideas.", "Here are three ways of carrying out analysis and synthesis:", "5 Whys", "\u00a0is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships of a particular problem.\u00a0The primary goal is to get to the bottom of a\u00a0problem by repeating the question \u201cWhy?\u201d where each answer leads to\u00a0the next question. Typically, five cycles are enough to achieve the goal here.", "Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated, asking a different sequence of questions each time.", "Here\u2019s an\u00a0", "example Toyota offers", "\u00a0of a potential 5 Whys that might be used at one of their plants.", "The main goal of the define stage is to club all the answers together and convert them into a coherent single statement.", "In other words: a meaningful and actionable problem statement or point of view. This focuses on the insights and needs of a particular user or composite character.", "The POV statement is created by\u00a0making sense of who the users are,\u00a0what their needs are, and the insights that come from the observations \r\nmade.\u00a0", "This is laid out in this easy formula from IDEO\u2019s Design School:", "And here\u2019s a similar take on a point of view:", "A problem statement is a roadmap that guides your team and focuses on the specific needs that you have \r\nuncovered. It creates a sense of possibility and optimism that \r\nallows team members to spark off ideas in the Ideation stage.\u00a0", "A good \r\nproblem statement should thus have the following traits:", "Now that you have your problem statement, it is time to reframe the problem/challenge using a \u201chow might we\u201d statement.", "As you\u2019ll have gathered, the define stage is messy. It\u2019s where we spend a lot of time understanding what the real problem is and what its root causes are. Without getting to the root of the problem, we will not be able to clearly define it, and any solution we come up with will fail.", "In the define stage, every possible iteration of the problem and its potential solution are explored. We gain a sharper focus by continuous exploration of all the variabilities that occur during this stage. This enables us to know what the real problem is and what the best solution is.\u00a0", "The end goal of this stage is to come up with a clearly defined and actionable problem statement that shows the team what the real problem is and who the users are. This lays the ground for coming up with ideas that suggest potential solutions to the problem.\u00a0"], "pubished_date": ["4 days ago"]}
