As well as authentication, I'll show you how to use its role-based authorization, which you can extend according to your needs.", "The Symfony Security Component allows you to set up security features like authentication, role-based authorization, CSRF tokens and more very easily. In fact, it's further divided into four sub-components which you can choose from according to your needs.", "The Security component has the following sub-components:", "In this article, we are going to explore the authentication feature provided by the ", "symfony/security-core", " component.", "As usual, we'll start with the installation and configuration instructions, and then we'll explore a few real-world examples to demonstrate the key concepts.", "In this section, we are going to install the Symfony Security component. I assume that you have already installed Composer on your system\u2014we'll need it to install the Security component available at Packagist.", "So go ahead and install the Security component using the following command.", "We are going to load users from the MySQL database in our example, so we'll also need a database abstraction layer. Let's install one of the most popular database abstraction layers: Doctrine DBAL.", "That should have created the ", "composer.json", " file, which should look like this:", "Let's modify the ", "composer.json", " file to look like the following one.", "As we have added a new ", "classmap", " entry, let's go ahead and update the composer autoloader by running the following command.", "Now, you can use the ", "Sfauth", " namespace to autoload classes under the ", "src", " directory.", "So that's the installation part, but how are you supposed to use it? In fact, it's just a matter of including the ", "autoload.php", " file created by Composer in your application, as shown in the following snippet.", "Firstly, let's go through the usual authentication flow provided by the Symfony Security component.", "In our example, we are going to match the user credentials against the MySQL database, thus we'll need to create the database user provider. We'll also create the database authentication provider that handles the authentication logic. And finally, we'll create the User class, which implements the ", "UserInterface", " interface.", "In this section, we'll create the User class which represents the user entity in the authentication process.", "Go ahead and create the ", "src/User/User.php", " file with the following contents.", "The important thing is that the User class must implement the Symfony Security\u00a0", "UserInterface", " interface. Apart from that, there's nothing out of the ordinary here.", "It's the responsibility of the user provider to load users from the back-end. In this section, we'll create the database user provider, which loads the user from the MySQL database.", "Let's create the ", "src/User/DatabaseUserProvider.php", " file with the following contents.", "The user provider must implement the ", "UserProviderInterface", " interface.

Please note that I've used the MD5 method for password encryption. Of course, you should use more secure encryption methods to store user passwords.", "So far, we have created all the necessary elements for authentication. In this section, we'll see how to put it all together to set up the authentication functionality.", "Go ahead and create the ", "db_auth.php", " file and populate it with the following contents.", "Recall the authentication flow which was discussed in the beginning of this article\u2014the above code reflects that sequence.", "The first thing was to retrieve the user credentials and create an unauthenticated token.", "Next, we have passed that token to the authentication manager for validation.", "When the authenticate method is called, a lot of things are happening behind the scenes.", "Firstly, the authentication manager selects an appropriate authentication provider. In our case, it's the ", "DatabaseAuthenticationProvider", " authentication provider, which will be selected for authentication.", "Next, it retrieves the user by the username from the ", "DatabaseUserProvider", " user provider.

Upon successful completion, you should receive an authenticated token, as shown in the following snippet.", "Once the user is authenticated, you can store the authenticated token in the session for the subsequent requests.", "And with that, we've completed our simple authentication demo!", "Today, we looked at the Symfony Security component, which allows you to integrate security features in your PHP applications. Specifically, we discussed the authentication feature provided by the symfony/security-core sub-component, and I showed you an example of how this functionality can be implemented in your own app.", "Feel free to post your thoughts using the feed below!"], "pubished_date": ["3 days ago"]}
