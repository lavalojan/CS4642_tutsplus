In this video and article I\u2019ll be explaining which I prefer, based on my own opinions and my own needs.", "As a web designer, you\u2019re more than likely familiar with these two apps\u2013or have at least heard of them. Sketch has been around a while (since 2010), Adobe XD is the newer kid on the block. But deciding upon which is \u201cbetter\u201d is difficult for a few reasons. What may work well for me, may not resonate in the same way with you. Usage comes down to the tools you use as a designer, your computer, the type of work you do, and other factors.", "I\u2019ve been using Sketch since version 3.0 (it\u2019s now at 51, because they ", "changed their version numbering system", ") and it\u2019s fair to say that Sketch has matured into a very capable piece of software. Before Sketch, I\u2019d been using Adobe Photoshop for years, and whilst the two are very different products, my priority was web design so the switch was comfortable for me.", "Adobe released XD in 2016, intended to address the fact that they didn\u2019t have a specific web design tool in their offering. XD (\u201cExperience Design\u201d) deliberately caters for UX and UI design.", "For details about which I prefer in which circumstances, take a look at the screencast. Here\u2019s a summary:", "Once you purchase Sketch, you own it forever, but you\u2019re only entitled to upgrades for a year.", "Originally planned as being part of Adobe\u2019s CC, XD has since been made free. The free plan does have some limitations, however, in terms of the number of shared prototypes, design specs, cloud storage, and TypeKit font selection. Upgrading to one of the paid plans will give you more.", "For me, Sketch will be my go-to for the foreseeable future. But that\u2019s largely because of the fact that I\u2019m more familiar with it, and I\u2019m a huge fan of the plugins available. It\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll prefer XD for other reasons.", "Sketch and Adobe XD have slightly different use cases, but there\u2019s also a lot of crossover. That crossover will likely become larger as time goes on and the two feed off one another. In the meantime, it\u2019s up to you to decide which is more suited to your needs.
