In my travels I found that unless you sat down with an experienced illustrator over a cup of coffee, you would not perhaps find out what I like to call \"soft skills\".\u00a0", "The name of soft skills does not imply that these skills are in any way unimportant; far from it. This is how you would approach a publisher or an author to do work, dealing with basic human nature, and how to deal with rejection. That rejection could be perceived\u2014they perhaps haven't acknowledged the gorgeously designed postcard you've sent them\u2014or actual rejection, whereby your style doesn't fit either the book or\u00a0the market for which you have set your sights on creating.\u00a0", "This article will give you encouragement and examine what goes on beneath the surface of the children's book illustrator's daily life.", "In this article I will be covering:", "My experience covers almost ten years of being a freelance illustrator, and to put my experience into perspective, I came into the illustration business knowing nothing.

Every seed you sow has the opportunity to be a healthy, thriving plant, but we all know that's not the case.

That's illustration.\u00a0", "Your website could be perfect, your postcards are beautifully laid out with the targeted artwork to the company you are wanting to work for, all your contact details are on there, your portfolio is a dream that so much work has gone into, and it shows.

Primarily, art directors (ADs) and\u00a0publishers are, for the most part, human. They are very busy, they are forgetful, they can't be bothered, they are on holiday. The reason why one\u00a0person got the job or even just an email from them may have been as simple as the fact that\u00a0their postcard got seen first. I'm not going to say it's luck whether or not you get chosen, but chance\u2014what you need to do is give yourself that chance and try to create as many opportunities as possible.\u00a0", "It's a fine balancing act of keeping yourself in the publisher's or AD's focus and\u00a0not becoming a pest.\u00a0", "Self-reflection is good, and\u00a0looking at your artwork and\u00a0considering what could be improved is a must.
