Together we'll draw the spine, the ribcage, the pelvis, the arms and legs\u2014every bone simplified and explained! ", "Draw a vertical line and divide it into five parts\u2014these will be the lumbar vertebrae. Remember to keep these first lines light, so that you can cover them later with the final lines. ", "Draw 12 more sections, making them smaller as you finish.", "Outline the discs between the vertebrae. ", "Give a shape to each vertebra.", "The ribcage will start three vertebrae from the bottom. Here, draw two squares, with a side five vertebrae long.", "From this place, draw a curve going right over the whole spine. This will be the basic outline of the ribcage.", "\"Cut\" the sides of the ribcage to round its shape.", "Draw the back part of the ribs now: 11 long and one short. Add pseudo-ribs to the rest of the vertebrae, too.", "We're going to the front of the ribcage now. Draw the sternum.", "Divide the sternum into quarters, then the bottom quarter into thirds.", "Add the front side of the ribs now. Seven of them should be connected directly to the sternum...", "... and the other three to the seventh one. The last two ribs are \"free\" and not connected to anything.", "You can outline the ribs now, giving them some thickness.", "The ribs are attached to the sternum with a cartilaginous part. Separate it from the rest with a curve.", "To add the neck and head, draw two lines on top using this measurement:", "Draw the circular cranium.", "Draw the skull using our separate tutorial:", "Draw the neck, using the same technique as with the other vertebrae.", "Mark the distance between the ribcage and the pelvis. It should be about two vertebrae long.", "Draw two squares similar to the ones before. ", "Cut their sides.", "Attach a \"bow\" to the last vertebra.", "Attach two big circles to the sides of this bow.", "Draw a big oval below.", "Draw a little circle below the oval.", "Draw a curve inside the tapered sides, connecting at the small circle.", "Turn the small circle into a narrow oval.", "Draw half of a heart below.", "Add two circles on the side of the narrow oval.", "Add \"openings\" in the shapes below.", "Add more circles that will help us create a detailed shape of the pelvis.", "Outline the pelvis using these guide lines.", "Let's add the sacrum, too. It's made of five fused vertebrae, but one of them has already been used in the \"bow\", so add only four sections.", "Draw the sides of the sacrum and connect them to the rest of the pelvis (the big circles).", "Add the tiny \"tail\" vertebrae.", "Although the sacrum vertebrae are fused, there are still some spaces visible between them. Draw them as simple circles.", "Draw a trapezoid around the ribcage to set the width of the shoulders. ", "Draw the curves of the clavicles, attached to the top of the sternum.", "Add two ovals at the ends of the clavicles.", "Outline the clavicles to give them thickness.", "Add a circle under the end of each clavicle. This will be the socket of the shoulder blade.", "Draw a tilted oval on its side.", "The clavicle is attached to the shoulder blade in a special way. Draw its back part and a protrusion in the front.", "Draw the shoulder blades now.", "Draw the ball of the humerus attached to the socket.", "Sketch the position of the arms. The upper arm should be longer than the forearm. The elbow in the neutral position lands exactly in the waist area.", "Draw the oval wrist. The right hand will be directed palm towards us, and the left one will be rotated, showing the side.", "Add the three fingers first, as they have similar lengths, with the middle one being the longest. ", "Add the other fingers now.", "Draw the arm bones using a few simple guide lines:", "There's cartilage between the arm and forearm, with a special shape that allows for rotation of the forearm bones:", "Draw the radius and ulna. Pay attention to their rotation in the left hand.", "Cross the fingers with a \"web\", marking the placement of the joints.", "Add the oval joints.", "Outline the finger bones.", "Add some small bones in the wrists.", "Draw the heads of the femur attached to the sockets in the pelvis.", "Draw the length of the femur. These bones should be slightly tilted towards the middle line. Make them about as long as the ribcage plus the waist.", "Add some space before you draw the tibia.", "Draw the tibia.", "Add some ovals to create the shape of the femur.", "Outline the femur.", "Add the patella.", "Add the guide shapes of the tibia.", "Outline the tibia.", "There's one more bone here, the fibula. Draw it in a similar way:", "Add some detail to the knee.", "Draw the bones of the ankle.", "Draw the toes with their full length.", "Mark the joints.", "Add ovals to the joints.", "Outline the toe bones.", "Add the heel at the back.", "Now it's time to finish the drawing! Take a darker tool, or erase most of the guide lines, and add all the crucial outlines.", "You can add some detail here and there that wasn't included in the guide lines:", "Now you know how to draw skeleton from scratch!
