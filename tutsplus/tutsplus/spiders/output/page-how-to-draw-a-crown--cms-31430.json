Precious metals, rare jewels of all colors, fancy ornaments... You can really let your imagination go wild when designing a crown! And you don't have to be a master blacksmith to create your own crown\u2014you can simply draw it!", "In this tutorial, I'll show you how to draw a classic crown with eight arches\u2014how to plan its structure and how to decorate it with ornaments and jewels. You can follow my steps directly or only in part, to create your own fantastic design!", "Draw a vertical line. This will be the line of symmetry for our crown. ", "Draw an ellipse on the bottom. ", "Draw an identical ellipse a bit higher. Together they'll create the \"band\" on the bottom of the crown.", "Draw two more ellipses inside, a little farther from the previous ones. We'll use these for decoration later.", "Draw a horizontal line over the ellipses. Connect it to their sides. ", "Draw another, shorter horizontal line above and connect it to the previous one.", "Draw ellipses around these lines. Their shape should be similar to the ones on the bottom.", "Connect both ellipses with curves.", "Our crown will have eight curved \"arches\"\u2014two of them on the sides, which we already have, two in the front and back (which are simply vertical lines), and four in between. To find a proper place for them, draw a mark on each ellipse\u2014use the same proportions each time.", "Draw a curve through these marks. Its shape should be a transition between the side curve and front curve (a line).", "Draw the back curves the same way.", "The arches need to connect at a single point, bending slightly in the middle. Draw this area as an ellipse, slightly lower than the top one.", "Draw an octagon in this ellipse\u2014one side for each arch. ", "\"Copy\" each side of the octagon along its corresponding curve to define the width of the whole arch.", "You can draw many of the width-defining lines to better see the shape of the arch before you attempt to draw it.", "Outline the arches.", "Draw the arches in the back the same way.", "Draw a circle on top of the crown.", "Cross it with two ellipses to better mark its 3D shape.", "We can decorate the crown however we want, but the key is to keep these decorations consistent. Sketch some guide lines to set up equal proportions for each arch.", "Draw circles in these guide lines, changing them to ellipses in perspective.", "Draw a band inside each arch, about one-quarter of the way from each side. ", "Draw a \"petal\" within these guide lines.", "Draw two vertical guide lines right next to the arches.", "Add some horizontal guide lines to draw the side petals of this ornamental flower. ", "Add two vertical guide lines below, creating a narrow band.", "Draw the bottom of the flower here.", "\"Bind\" the petals in the middle.", "Draw decorative grooves over the crown's main band.", "Draw a cross on top of the crown.", "Let's add thin decorative bands on the arches and the ball.", "Fill these bands with tiny golden pearls.", "Let's add some little prongs to make the bottom more interesting.", "The inside of the crown is often filled with a cloth \"cap\". Draw its outline.", "Finally, the most fun part! Let's add some shiny jewels. Draw circles right under each arch (turn them into ellipses in perspective).", "You can learn about drawing different crystals/diamonds from these tutorials:", "Draw a smaller circle/ellipse inside\u2014the flat top of the jewel. Because it's higher than the previous circle, it should also \"move away\" from the center as the perspective shifts.", "Draw an octagon inside each little circle.", "Draw lines going from the corners of the octagon. Follow the perspective\u2014these lines mark the slanted sides of the jewel.", "Add pearls between these jewels.", "The arches shouldn't stay empty, either. Draw some guide lines on them first.", "Draw rectangles in these guide lines.", "Draw smaller, shifted rectangles inside.", "Draw the slanted edges.", "Each jewel can be surrounded with smaller jewels\u2014little \"pearls\"...", "... or even little crystals:", "Finally, outline the whole crown with ink and erase the guide lines.", "Now you know how to draw a beautiful crown! Do you want to draw something else? We have a variety of drawing tutorials here on Envato Tuts+!", "You can also learn how to shade your crown with pencils to make it look like shiny metal in this tutorial:"], "pubished_date": ["2 Aug 2018"]}
