Find out in this article where I interviewed recruiters and HR managers on their views about this controversial resume format.", "Many applicants think writing a resume is as simple as\r\nlisting all the positions they\u2019ve ever held, then rounding it up with a bunch of\r\nimpressive achievements and skills. But writing a resume that leads to an\r\ninterview is more complicated than that. A resume is a marketing tool, a\r\ncontinuously evolving advertisement of your talents, and like any ad in\r\nany medium, it needs to be concise and attention-grabbing.\u00a0", "How can you write an attention-grabbing resume? There\u2019s a\r\nlot that goes into that process, but it all starts with picking the ", "right\r\nresume format", ". You need to pick one with a strong hook and a narrative\r\nstructure that paints your professional history in the best light, one that\r\nemphasizes your positives and downplays your flaws or missing skills.\u00a0", "In this tutorial, we'll take a close look at the functional resume. You'll learn when a functional resume format is commonly used and discover the truth about how recruiters view functional resumes. I'll also provide you with some alternatives to using a functional resume.", "Now when it comes to hiding employment gaps or questionable\r\ncareer trajectories, functional resumes are usually the go-to option. That\u2019s because a functional resume groups all your\r\nskills and achievements in one list at the top of the resume, regardless of\r\nwhen or how you acquired them. It emphasizes what you\u2019ve accomplished without\r\ngoing into details on whether those accomplishments were on a professional,\r\nacademic, or voluntary setting.\u00a0", "What is a functional resume?", "Like other resume formats, it begins with a professional or\r\nqualifications summary but its work history section is just a list of job\r\ntitles and employers because all the achievements and responsibilities usually\r\nlisted under each job title are already grouped at the aforementioned list of\r\nskills at the top of the document. ", "Who might benefit from using a functional resume? The functional resume format is often suggested for candidates with a work\r\nhistory that they want to conceal. Applicants re-entering the workforce\r\nafter taking care of a sick parent, or raising their kids, for instance, may\r\nwant to use a functional resume to hide a long employment gap. The same goes\r\nfor applicants who left the corporate world, but continued acquiring skills\r\nthrough volunteer work. ", "Candidates with an unclear career path because they kept\r\nswitching industries or took different kinds of temp work may also want to hide\r\ntheir career history using a functional resume. This format, however, isn\u2019t\r\njust for those questionable career histories. It\u2019s also suggested for\r\ncandidates overqualified for the position they\u2019re applying for based on their\r\nprevious job title. For instance, a Creative Director finding it hard to land similar employment might apply for a Graphic\r\nDesigner or even an Account Executive position just to get hired. ", "Of course, those are all theories and well-meaning advice\r\ngiven without hard data. There\u2019s no survey or statistic published on the effectiveness\r\nof functional resumes. In reality, functional resumes get thrown out in the\r\nearly stage of the application process. ", "Why? Because recruiters and everyone who reads resumes for a\r\nliving hate it.", "If you're considering using a functional resume, be sure to read the rest of this article first. If you're still convinced a functional resume is for you, here's our tutorial on how to write one:", "I\u2019ve talked to in-house recruiters, corporate headhunters,\r\nhiring managers, and small business owners, and they all have one thing in\r\ncommon: they don\u2019t like functional resumes.

", "When that happens, you run the risk of getting your resume\r\nthrown out just because it\u2019s difficult to read. Someone less qualified than you\r\nmight even make it to the interview list, just because their resume is easier\r\non the eyes. ", "Hiring candidates, whether it\u2019s for entry or mid-level jobs\r\nis fast and furious because each job ad attracts an ", "average of 250 resumes", ". Plus, non-exclusive headhunters are forced to\r\ncompete with other agencies to fill the same roles that just put on added pressure to the headhunters. ", "With all those resumes to review, interviews to schedule and\r\nall the paperwork in between, guess how much time a typical recruiter has to\r\nread a resume? ", "About ", "six seconds", ".\u00a0", "During those six seconds, recruiters work fast to find your:", "Unfortunately, a functional resume hides almost all of that\r\ninformation. Some functional resumes include job titles, some don\u2019t. It\u2019s\r\nimpossible to tell the highest level of responsibility you\u2019ve achieved in\r\na functional resume format because all the bullet-point achievements and skills\r\nnormally in the professional history section are jumbled up together instead of\r\nseparated into different job entries.

", "Recruiters and hiring managers read resumes every day, and\r\nthey\u2019re aware that the functional resume format is commonly used to hide employment gaps. As a\r\nresult, this intentional ambiguity forces them to draw their own conclusions\r\nabout your professional history.", "So whatever you put in the skills section, recruiters will\r\nskip straight to your professional history to figure out what you\u2019re trying to\r\nhide. But often this is just to satisfy their curiosity; they\u2019ve already\r\ndecided they don\u2019t like you as an applicant because you\u2019re hiding something. Some\r\nof them might not even bother doing this\u2014they\u2019ll just move on to the next application.\r\nObviously, this isn\u2019t the effect you\u2019re trying to achieve with your\r\napplication.", "You've got to remember that recruiters aren\u2019t your friends,\r\nalthough they may appear friendly and nice over the phone. They don\u2019t work for\r\nyou. They work for the hiring company.\u00a0", "William Haynes", ",\r\nRegional Recruiting Manager at The Princeton Review, said he once thought\r\nfunctional resumes would be ideal for teachers. Many of the teachers he hires\r\nfor The Princeton Review work part-time, already have jobs or are full-time students, so he thought their job history\r\nwouldn\u2019t be as important, but his opinion changed over time.", "Even experienced and qualified candidates can look like they\u2019re hiding\r\nsomething when they use a functional resume. Your resume might show impressive\r\nskills, but it'll still leave recruiters wondering if you were terminated, or\r\nif you don\u2019t have enough years under your belt.", "Some of the reasons above may be subjective or just based on\r\nthe experience of a limited few. Below is a list of the tactical disadvantages\r\nof this format based on its content and structure. ", "If you've got C++ or Ruby on Rails programming experience, it'll carry more weight if you can link it to a specific job, more so if you\u2019ve\r\nheld that job for a few years. For a recruiter, a skill listed could mean\r\nanything from a book you\u2019ve read to a short seminar you took, both of which can\u2019t\r\nbe equated to an actual job where you get experience from real-world projects\r\nand feedback from developers ahead of you in their career.", "Like Boyer explained, a functional resume takes all your\r\nskills and achievements out of chronological sequence, making it harder for the\r\nrecruiters to decipher your experience\u2019s relevance in today\u2019s market.

You might have been a skilled advertiser five\r\nyears ago, but the market has changed so much since then.", "Functional resumes also don\u2019t show career trajectory, so\r\nrecruiters can\u2019t tell if you\u2019ve moved past the entry-level skills required for\r\nyour job or if you\u2019re just fluffing up your resume with skills you don\u2019t have.", "Some companies and jobs like things to be done a specific\r\nway. Sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re just used to it, other times it\u2019s because\r\nthey've got a software or procedure that requires things to be done that way.
