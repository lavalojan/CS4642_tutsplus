Our brains are very good at spotting patterns and making associations, so we constantly process the stream of information about the world around us and use it to form beliefs. Generally, the purpose of belief formation is to help us understand the world and stay safe.", "In early childhood, these beliefs are usually based on our own experiences and shaped by our parents or other dominant figures in our lives. If I hit someone, I get punished, so hitting people must be bad. If I say \u201c", "please", "\u201d and \u201c", "thank you", "\u201d, I get rewarded. So, being polite must be good.", "As we get older, we start to form more complex beliefs and are able to draw on a much wider range of sources such as books, movies, TV advertisements, the behaviour of our peers, and so on.\u00a0", "Nevertheless, the core beliefs that we formed as young children can be very powerful, and even when we encounter new information or explanations, we often cling to our old beliefs.\u00a0", "For example, a young boy with hard-working parents who are often absent may form the belief: \u201c", "I\u2019m not good enough for them to want to be with me", ".\u201d Later, he may come to understand that his parents work hard for many reasons, including their love for him and desire to provide for him, but that early belief may be so deeply engrained that he continues to hold onto it.", "Part of the reason for this is that we don\u2019t like being wrong. Once we've formed a belief, we tend to look for more evidence to support that belief and to discount contradictory evidence. This gives us a stable foundation for understanding a world that would otherwise be very confusing, but it also means that beliefs can be tough to get rid of, even when they're holding us back.", "So, as we\u2019ve just discovered, belief formation starts early in life, and once beliefs are formed, they're quite resistant to change.", "That should go a long way to explaining why many of our beliefs are limiting. Patterns that we observed as children and that helped us to navigate kindergarten or the school playground may not serve us in the adult world.", "If you grew up in an abusive or neglectful environment, it should be pretty clear that you\u2019ll have a lot of toxic beliefs about yourself.

They may or may not be true or helpful, but they still dictate the way we behave in life. If we believe that we\u2019re not good enough, we won\u2019t put ourselves forward for promotion\u2014and seeing someone else get promoted ahead of us will then reinforce that same belief.

So lay the blame aside for now, and try to analyse what went wrong.", "Here are some questions you can ask yourself:", "Continue asking questions like this, trying to tease out the deeper causes of your past behaviour.

Could they be responsible for the problems you identified in your blame-free analysis?", "As I mentioned, self-limiting beliefs can be hard to identify, so you may need more time. Use these questions to get you started, but the process may take longer.

Again, this is not a simple task, but let\u2019s look at six techniques that can be helpful:", "This may sound strange. These are limiting beliefs that are holding you back, so what purpose could they have?", "The point is that all beliefs have a purpose, and usually that purpose is somehow connected to keeping you safe or protecting you from pain or another negative outcome.", "In the case of limiting beliefs, this purpose may be misguided, but it does exist, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful. For example, you may be blocked from making progress by the belief that you shouldn\u2019t do anything unless you can do it perfectly. This kind of perfectionism can be crippling, but at its root, it\u2019s probably aimed at protecting you from the pain or humiliation that you believe will result if you put less-than-perfect work out into the world.\u00a0", "Once you\u2019ve identified the purpose of your belief and where it came from, start to question whether it\u2019s still valid or useful.", "In the perfectionism example, ask yourself what the outcome would be if you did let yourself launch a product or business that contained a tiny flaw? Is that worse than the outcome of doing nothing? Overall, does your perfectionism lead to more positive or negative results?", "Go through this process with each of the limiting beliefs you identified. Even if you think you know the answers already, you might come up with something new, and the very process of overtly questioning your limiting beliefs can be helpful in reducing their power.", "Humour can be a very effective unblocking tool. It\u2019s hard for something to have power over you when you\u2019re laughing at it.\u00a0", "So try to make jokes out of your limiting beliefs. Take them to extremes and come up with absurd scenarios that make you laugh, or at least not take yourself and your beliefs so seriously.\u00a0", "To break the power of your old beliefs, you also need to replace them with new ones.

Beliefs are basically patterns that the brain has identified, so by feeding it new patterns, you can start to rewire it.", "There are lots of techniques you can use here. You could try affirmations (writing or speaking your new beliefs repeatedly at specific times every day). You could use a physical object, like a stone you carry in your pocket, as a constant reminder of your new intentions. You could set up habits or rituals to support the new belief, such as deliberately putting the new belief into practice in a small way every day (make a small, intentional mistake if you\u2019re battling perfectionism, for example).", "To sustain you in what will be a long and sometimes difficult process, look for examples to follow.

In comparison, consumers in America spent USD $3.54 billion online on Black Friday.", "While China\u2019s sales numbers make the headlines in Forbes and Business Insider, doing online business in China is all about understanding the fine print. In this tutorial, we discuss the details and tactics of search engine optimization (SEO) for China the organic way\u2014without paid advertising.", "Search engines are a key channel to reach China\u2019s 721 million online users and attract traffic to your website. First, though, you need to understand the local search players. Foreign search companies, such as Bing and Yahoo!, have a negligible share of the China market, and Google\u2019s search portal is inaccessible inside mainland China. Meanwhile, ", "local search companies", " such as Baidu (which enjoys a \u00b177% market share), 360 (8%), Shenma (6.9%), and Sugou (4.6%) dominate the China market.", "Due to their visual aesthetics, Chinese search engines can be deceiving at first look. They resemble Google, Bing, and Yahoo! with a similar user interface and array of search filters. But behind their visual similarities lie complex algorithms that instantly identify if your site is relevant for China. This includes knowing whether your company is registered in China.", "Registering a local commercial entity is vital to getting business done in China. Want to register a corporate social media account on a popular Chinese platform? You need a Chinese business license. Want to host your website on a local web hosting server? You need a Chinese business license. Want to maximize your potential to rank high on local search engines? Yes, ideally you need a Chinese business license\u2026", "How do search engines know if you have a Chinese business license? They can discern this information from crawling your website\u2019s footer. Corporate websites approved by China\u2019s Ministry of Information and Industry Technology (MIIT) display what is called an ICP registration number in their site\u2019s footer.\u00a0", "To apply for an ICP license for a corporate website, applicants must have a physical presence and registered business entity in Mainland China. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t mean you can rent a serviced office in Hong Kong and apply online for a business number. Overseas companies must establish legitimate business operations in mainland China (not Hong Kong), including a payroll, an office address, approval from the local authorities, and meet on-going operation requirements. Only when a company is registered in China can they apply for an ICP license. For companies that wish to engage in e-commerce and accept online payments in China, there are also other ", "ICP license requirements", " and a Commercial ICP License is required.\u00a0", "Obtaining an ICP license is paramount to maximizing your search visibility in China. Hosting on a local hosting provider informs the search engines that your site is approved and relevant to China. In addition, your website will load faster and this has a positive impact on user experience, which search engines account for in their page ranking algorithm.", "Due to the financial and administrative requirements of operating a business in China, registering a commercial entity in China for the sole purpose of boosting your search rankings is not a recommended strategy.\u00a0", "Organizations ineligible for an ICP license should focus on other SEO factors such as load speed. Outside of the mainland, the next best option is to host in Hong Kong. Hosting in Hong Kong offers a stable connection to the mainland, minimizes latency between your server and end-users in China, and importantly, doesn\u2019t necessitate ICP registration. Also on the plus side, hosting in Hong Kong tends to be more cost-effective than hosting in Japan, Korea, and Singapore.\u00a0", "Mobile SEO in China is extremely important. As ", "PwC", " reported in their Total Retail 2017 Survey, 52% of consumers in China buy online using their mobile on a weekly or daily basis, as compared to 14% of consumers globally.", "In regard to mobile SEO, the biggest tripping point for foreign websites is not registering a mobile sitemap. The good news is you don\u2019t need a special license or a locally registered business to complete this step. The trick is taking the time to register both a mobile and desktop sitemap with the major search engine providers.\u00a0", "Unlike their Western counterparts, Chinese search engines don\u2019t have the same sophisticated technology to detect and index mobile web design. This being the case, site owners should upload two separate sitemaps to Chinese search engines in order to be properly indexed: one sitemap for mobile and one sitemap for desktop.", "The format for submitting a mobile and desktop sitemap should be XML and can be submitted through Baidu Webmaster Tool. However, don\u2019t expect the same results with Baidu as Google. If you have 1,000 web pages on your site, Google may only take a few days to index your site. Baidu, however, might take 1-3 months to index your full site.\u00a0", "Chinese SEO experts counter this slow wait time by adding an HTML sitemap to the website footer, which is crawled separately by the likes of Baidu. This can provide a big help in ensuring your website is fully indexed.\u00a0", "Multi-language site owners should submit multiple sitemaps to cover each potential audience:", "Chinese search engines have the same goal as Google, Bing, and Russia\u2019s Yandex; and that is to display relevant web page content to users and reward quality content. Important factors include keyword density, URLs, friendly backlinks, bounce rate, and time-on-page. Let\u2019s examine them one by one.", "High value search terms are vital to any SEO strategy and China is no exception. This includes in-depth keyword research and adding keywords to your metadata descriptions, title headings (H1 tags), and subheadings (other H tags). You should also avoid keyword-stuffing as this is likely to penalize your site. The optimal keyword density is approximately 4% per page.\u00a0", "Much of your keyword research will take place in Chinese, including navigating the search tool interface. Having a Chinese speaker on hand is definitely recommended!\u00a0", "A big question for site owners is \u201cshould URL permalinks (the unique page information after your domain name, such as category and page name) also use Chinese characters?\u201d Strangely enough, Pinyin (Western romanization of Chinese characters) is the way to go for URL links. Whereas Google can return websites in their search results with Chinese characters in their URL, Baidu still relies on Pinyin.", "For example:\u00a0", "https://yoursite.com/chanpin/shouji", "Backlinks in China have experienced a similar rollercoaster of algorithm changes to the West. Buying a high volume of links that directed to your site was rife a few years ago\u2014and still is\u2014but Baidu\u2019s rules have since changed. In 2016, Baidu announced algorithm rule changes regarding backlinks. Rather than allocate positive SEO juice to sites with backlinks from all external sites, Baidu now prioritizes ", "friendly backlinks", ".\u00a0", "Friendly backlinks are links that originate from websites relevant to your site\u2019s content or those from the same industry. For example, backlinks from gaming sites to your e-commerce site selling fresh food would probably not qualify as a friendly link in the eyes of Baidu. Backlinks from food blogs, on the other hand, would. If the definition of \u201cfriendly\u201d seems vague and fuzzy, that\u2019s because it is!\u00a0", "In any case, use common sense to build link relationships with relevant websites and stay well away from irrelevant websites involved in questionable business activities, such as online gambling.\u00a0", "Another popular backlink strategy in China is to partner with other websites and share footer links. Again, friendly links are the most viable strategy.\u00a0", "Note", ": penalties apply to websites that include 30 or more links in their footer.\u00a0", "Other recommended backlink strategies include adding keywords in anchor text (hyperlinks) and to pursue quality over quantity. This means focusing on backlinks from high authority sites. \u201cNo-follow\u201d links, most often from social media platforms, also apply to China and add no value to your site\u2019s SEO juice other than bringing additional traffic to your site.\u00a0 \u00a0", "Focusing attention on your content and user experience is a key way to improve time-on-page and to reduce bounce rate. Multimedia content is extremely popular in China and vital to engaging Chinese users.\u00a0", "In regard to optimal time-on-page and bounce rate metrics, there\u2019s no defined benchmark for the purpose of search engine optimization. SEO is a game of comparative advantage and whether your bounce rate is 90% or 50%, the key is how you compare with your competitors. Your website will fare better on these two SEO metrics if you stay ahead of other websites competing for the same keywords.\u00a0", "Time-on-page and bounce rates tend to take a hammering in China due to a couple of different reasons. One is that China is a mobile-centric market and users can be easily distracted. The second is the prevalence of machine-generated content on Chinese websites. The bounce rate for websites in China, therefore, is often 80% or higher.", "As always, providing quality content is a simple rule to push ahead of the competition. But you\u2019ll need to move fast because the quality of content marketing and thought leadership in China is on the rise. Social sharing is the quickest way to reach an audience in China and companies are recognizing this. Good content creators, including individuals and agencies, are henceforth seeing more demand for their work.", "To optimize your website for China, you may need to call on a range of professional service providers to assist with content writing, translation, and keyword research. This leads us to the final section of this article and the all-important language factor.", "Outside of special cases, always opt for Simplified Chinese characters. While Baidu introduced English-language search results back in 2011 through a partnership with Bing, Chinese characters remain the dominant choice for Chinese netizens to search and read online information.", "Next, note that plural and singular keyword strategies don\u2019t work in Chinese. While search experts in the West know that \u201chotels in London\u201d and \u201chotel in London\u201d indicate vastly different stages in the customer decision/purchasing cycle, plural search terms in Chinese are virtually redundant. When a Chinese user is searching for inspiration and aggregated content/reviews for hotels in Hong Kong they\u2019ll search in Chinese characters for \u201cHong Kong hotel\u201d (\u9999\u6e2f\u9152\u5e97). When they are ready to book a hotel in Hong Kong they\u2019ll also search for \u201cHong Kong hotel\u201d (\u9999\u6e2f\u9152\u5e97). Moreover, this means there\u2019s more competition for keywords in the Chinese language than there is in English because of fewer search variations.", "Although it\u2019s possible to install dynamic Chinese translation to convert existing content from another language when users with a Chinese IP address visit your website, this makes it impossible for Chinese search engines to index the Chinese version of your site. Investing in the professional translation of your content is the only way to go.\u00a0", "While some website owners opt to add a subdomain to their existing website to host Chinese-language content, it\u2019s better to have a stand-alone site designed for users in China, including Chinese social media integration and design aesthetics. Competition in China is fierce and while local search engines won\u2019t penalize you for hosting content on a subdomain, you will be handing your competitors an opportunity to one-up you with a top-level domain site which carries more weight from an SEO perspective.", "WordPress users may be familiar with the plugin ", "Yoast", ", which is a popular SEO tool for websites to meet SEO guidelines set by Google. Yoast can also be used for configuring your China website meta information, but keep in mind that the logic of this plugin is to rank high on Google and not on Chinese search engines.", "Baidu, for example, allows 70 Chinese characters for a meta description and 20-30 characters for the page\u2019s title. And while permalinks generally use Pinyin, Chinese characters are a must for your site\u2019s meta descriptions as they will be displayed not only to the search engine crawlers but also to end-users on the search results page.", "Search engine optimization is a complex art and there are always more new techniques to optimize your site for search visibility. Site owners who understand the fine details of search optimization in China and who invest in the right resources to implement their strategy will be well placed to gradually outpace their international peers and compete with local competitors for search supremacy.", "As a foreign entity approaching the Chinese market, hosting on a server located in the mainland should be a top priority, but Hong Kong is the next best option for organizations that are ineligible for an ICP license.", "The next steps are to enlist a first-language Chinese speaker to design a keyword strategy and develop your site content in Chinese. You may also need to consider bringing in a specialist agency to help with keyword optimization and paid search engine marketing (SEM) to give your site a boost in the short-term.

How to Define & Live by Them"], "author": ["Andrew Blackman"], "auther_details": ["Freelance writer and editor"], "length": ["Beginner", "Long"], "body": ["Living by your personal values sounds easy\u2014at least in theory. Your values, after all, are simply the things that are important to you in life, so it should be natural to live by them.", "And yet so many of us don\u2019t consistently live by our values. Have you ever been in any of these situations?", "If any of these resonate with you, then this tutorial will help you. In it, you\u2019ll learn what personal values are and why they\u2019re important. Then we\u2019ll go through all the steps involved in defining and prioritising your values, changing them as necessary, and living by them so that your actions are aligned with your values.", "When you live by your values, you feel better about yourself and are more focused on doing the things that are important to you. In this tutorial, you\u2019ll see how to achieve that.", "Let\u2019s start with a personal values definition. Personal values are the things that are important to us, the characteristics and behaviours that motivate us and guide our decisions.", "For example, maybe you value honesty. You believe in being honest wherever possible and you think it\u2019s important to say what you really think. When you don\u2019t speak your mind, you probably feel disappointed in yourself.", "Or maybe you value kindness. You jump at the chance to help other people, and you\u2019re generous in giving your time and resources to worthy causes or to friends and family.", "Those are just two examples of personal values out of many. Everyone has their own personal values, and they can be quite different. Some people are competitive, while others value cooperation. Some people value adventure, while others prefer security.", "Values matter because you\u2019re likely to feel better if you\u2019re living according to your values and to feel worse if you don\u2019t. This applies both to day-to-day decisions and to larger life choices.", "If you value adventure, for example, you\u2019ll probably feel stifled if you let yourself be pressured by parents or others into making \u201csafe\u201d choices like a stable office job and a settled home life. For you, a career that involves travel, starting your own business, or other opportunities for risk and adventure may be more appropriate.\u00a0", "On the other hand, if you value security, the opposite applies. What some people would view as a \u201cdream\u201d opportunity to travel the world and be your own boss may leave you feeling insecure and craving a more settled existence.\u00a0", "Everybody is different, and what makes one person happy may leave another person feeling anxious or disengaged. Defining your personal values and then living by them can help you to feel more fulfilled and to make choices that make\u00a0", "you\u00a0", "happy, even if they don\u2019t make sense to other people. You\u2019ll see how to go about doing that in the following sections.", "What makes you feel good? That\u2019s a good place to start when figuring out what your values are.", "No, \u201cice cream\u201d isn\u2019t a value. What we\u2019re talking about here are characteristics or ways of behaving in the world. As we saw above, someone who values honesty will feel good when they tell the truth.", "Conversely, that same person will feel bad about themselves when they\u00a0", "don\u2019t\u00a0", "tell the truth. So negative emotions can also be a good guide to your values. When have you felt disappointed in yourself or like you were a fraud? What behaviour led up to that?", "Here are some more questions to get you started:", "Take a blank sheet of paper and quickly brainstorm some answers to these questions. Then use those answers as guides to figuring out your personal values.\u00a0", "In some cases, the values will be easy to figure out. If you wrote \u201ca loving relationship\u201d in response to the question about what\u2019s important to you, then \u201clove\u201d is an important personal value for you. If you wrote \u201cbeing happy,\u201d then you value happiness.", "Others may require a bit more work, though. For example, if you\u2019re inspired by stories of successful entrepreneurs, maybe you value determination or achievement, or maybe it\u2019s wealth and success. If you\u2019re inspired by activists trying to change the world, maybe you value courage or integrity, or maybe it\u2019s justice or peace. Try to examine what exactly it is about those stories or experiences that you relate to.", "To help you, here\u2019s a short list of personal values.\u00a0", "This is by no means an exhaustive list of personal values. I\u2019m sure you can think of plenty more. The idea isn't to pick items from a list, but to come up with your own based on your own experiences and personality, so please use these as examples of personal values, but don\u2019t feel limited by them. Let your imagination run free!", "When you\u2019ve finished brainstorming, you may have half a dozen values, or you may have a huge list of dozens. If you\u2019re in the second camp, try to cut the list down to something manageable\u2014perhaps ten values that mean the most to you. If you\u2019re struggling, try assigning scores to each one and then sorting the list in order.", "Once you\u2019ve come up with a list, it's important to prioritise your values.\u00a0", "Why? Because prioritising can help you get even closer to defining what\u2019s important to you.\u00a0", "Your overall list of values may include quite disparate values. If you value honesty, health, kindness, adventure and half a dozen other things, it doesn\u2019t give you a clear direction. But if you put \u201chealth\u201d right at the top of your list, you\u2019ll know that establishing a daily exercise routine and cutting out the junk food should be priorities for you. If \u201cadventure\u201d is at the top, on the other hand, maybe planning that trip to South America will come first.", "Ideally, of course, you\u2019ll live according to all the values on your list. But your time and energy are limited. Prioritising helps you to ensure that you\u2019re spending them on the most important things that'll have the biggest payoff in your life.", "So take some time to reorder the items in your list by using the scoring system we covered in the last section. Or you could compare each item in turn and ask yourself which you would work on if you could do only one. Take your time, and keep going until you end up with a final order you\u2019re happy with.", "Having a list of values on a sheet of paper is nice, but it doesn\u2019t change anything. To see a difference in your life, you\u2019ll have to start living by your values. As we\u2019ve seen, that can be easier said than done. So in this section, we\u2019ll look at how to use your values to actually live your life and make decisions.", "First, let\u2019s look at the big picture. Are you living according to your values in your life as a whole? Does your career choice reflect your values? How about your activities outside of work? Are you spending your time on things that matter to you?", "If not, don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s quite common for our lives to diverge from our values for any number of reasons. Here\u2019s how to get things back on track.", "For each of your values, make a list of things you could do to put those values into practice. For example, if you wrote \u201cLearning,\u201d you could go back to college and do that degree you\u2019ve always dreamed of. Or you could commit to read a book every week on a subject that you care about. Or you could take online training courses or sign up for classes at your local adult education centre. There are so many possibilities.", "Don\u2019t be constrained by practical considerations at this stage. Just write down possibilities, even if you think you can\u2019t afford them or don\u2019t have time. Make a list of things you\u00a0", "could\u00a0", "do to live by your values.", "You should end up with a long list of possible actions for each value. The next step is to make them into goals for the next week, month, year, and perhaps longer. For detailed instructions on how to do that, see the following tutorials:", "If you already have goals that you\u2019ve set before, you\u2019ll also need to take one additional step. For each goal, ask yourself whether it aligns with any of your personal values. If not, why are you doing it? Unless there\u2019s a very good practical reason, delete it and focus instead on the new goals that do help you live according to your values.\u00a0", "Living your values is about more than the big, long-term goals, however. It\u2019s also about the small, day-to-day decisions. In the moment, do you react to situations in ways that align with your values?\u00a0", "If you value compassion, for example, do you regularly display compassion towards others, or do you sometimes slip into judgment and blame? If you value health, do you always take care of your body, or do you sometimes end up eating burgers instead of bulgur?", "It\u2019s not always easy to make your actions align with your values. Anything from force of habit to the lure of immediate gratification can be powerful enough to make us forget those good intentions and act in ways that don\u2019t reflect our values.", "You've got many techniques available to you to help you change your reactions and live more consciously in accordance with your values. For example, you could:", "You can find plenty more ideas in the following tutorials. Although a couple\u00a0of them are about productivity, which is different from living by your\u00a0values, some of the techniques about overcoming distractions and following up on good intentions are relevant here.", "So far, it sounds quite simple, doesn\u2019t it? So why do so many of us still struggle to live according to our values?", "Sometimes it\u2019s about lack of clarity or not knowing what your values really are. The values exercises in this tutorial should deal with that problem quite effectively.", "But there are other possible barriers, too. What if your personal values come into conflict with those of your family or the wider society? For example, you may value tolerance, but the society you live in may stand quite strongly against tolerance, at least of certain groups.\u00a0", "Or perhaps you're facing a conflict between your personal values and the practical situation you find yourself in. You may value creativity, but you've got family members to take care of, so you can\u2019t take the risk of embarking on an art career. Or you may value honesty, but feel that there are certain lies you need to tell in order to preserve important relationships, to keep your job, or whatever else.", "These are important barriers, and they're worth reflecting on seriously. But it\u2019s also worth remembering that there are many ways to live your values, and you don\u2019t have to reject all compromises and ignore practical considerations.\u00a0", "For example, it\u2019s quite possible to live according to a value of honesty while also inserting a caveat like \u201c... as long as my honesty doesn\u2019t hurt other people.\u201d That would help preserve those important relationships. And if you've got to be dishonest in order to keep your job, maybe that\u2019s a signal that, in the long term, you need to find a new job. But in the short term, you don\u2019t need to get fired by telling your boss exactly what you think. You can compromise for now, while moving in the long term towards a solution that\u2019s more in line with your values.", "If your values come into conflict with those of others or the wider society, you may face some difficulties, but you can still live with integrity in your own life. If your circumstances allow, you can also fight to change society according to your own beliefs. Look at many of the heroes of history like Susan B. Anthony or Martin Luther King, Jr., and you\u2019ll find people whose personal values came into conflict with those of their time. But if you don\u2019t feel ready for that kind of struggle, then you could choose to focus on your own actions and on living according to your own values, without challenging those around you who live differently.\u00a0", "Your personal values aren't set in stone. While some of your core values will probably stay the same throughout your life, others may change as your life circumstances change or simply as you get older and start to have a different view of what\u2019s important. Or even if the values stay the same, the order in which you prioritise them may shift.", "For example, starting a family and having children to take care of may cause you to value security and financial stability more highly than you did when you were single. Or a divorce may result in a renewed desire for freedom and self-discovery.\u00a0", "So it\u2019s worth checking in regularly to see if your values have changed. Repeat the process of brainstorming, listing and prioritising, and see if your results are different.", "How often should you do this? At least once a year is probably a good idea, and any time you go through a major life change like job loss, bereavement, illness, divorce, etc.", "Of course, you\u2019ll also want to keep reading your values and referring to them much more regularly than once a year, and if at any time you notice that something just doesn\u2019t feel right any more, feel free to revise your values then and there.", "Once you\u2019ve come up with your new list, re-examine your goals and rewrite them where necessary to reflect your new or newly prioritised values. And start using your revised list of values to inform and direct your daily life, as discussed in the previous section.\u00a0", "We've covered a lot of ground in this tutorial, and I hope you're now much clearer about what personal values are, why they're important, and how you can do a better job of living in alignment with your values.", "To read more about values, but from a business rather than a personal perspective, see the following tutorials:", "The next step, if you haven't already, is to put the lessons from this tutorial into practice.

Find out in this article where I interviewed recruiters and HR managers on their views about this controversial resume format.", "Many applicants think writing a resume is as simple as\r\nlisting all the positions they\u2019ve ever held, then rounding it up with a bunch of\r\nimpressive achievements and skills. But writing a resume that leads to an\r\ninterview is more complicated than that. A resume is a marketing tool, a\r\ncontinuously evolving advertisement of your talents, and like any ad in\r\nany medium, it needs to be concise and attention-grabbing.\u00a0", "How can you write an attention-grabbing resume? There\u2019s a\r\nlot that goes into that process, but it all starts with picking the ", "right\r\nresume format", ". You need to pick one with a strong hook and a narrative\r\nstructure that paints your professional history in the best light, one that\r\nemphasizes your positives and downplays your flaws or missing skills.\u00a0", "In this tutorial, we'll take a close look at the functional resume. You'll learn when a functional resume format is commonly used and discover the truth about how recruiters view functional resumes. I'll also provide you with some alternatives to using a functional resume.", "Now when it comes to hiding employment gaps or questionable\r\ncareer trajectories, functional resumes are usually the go-to option. That\u2019s because a functional resume groups all your\r\nskills and achievements in one list at the top of the resume, regardless of\r\nwhen or how you acquired them. It emphasizes what you\u2019ve accomplished without\r\ngoing into details on whether those accomplishments were on a professional,\r\nacademic, or voluntary setting.\u00a0", "What is a functional resume?", "Like other resume formats, it begins with a professional or\r\nqualifications summary but its work history section is just a list of job\r\ntitles and employers because all the achievements and responsibilities usually\r\nlisted under each job title are already grouped at the aforementioned list of\r\nskills at the top of the document. ", "Who might benefit from using a functional resume? The functional resume format is often suggested for candidates with a work\r\nhistory that they want to conceal. Applicants re-entering the workforce\r\nafter taking care of a sick parent, or raising their kids, for instance, may\r\nwant to use a functional resume to hide a long employment gap. The same goes\r\nfor applicants who left the corporate world, but continued acquiring skills\r\nthrough volunteer work. ", "Candidates with an unclear career path because they kept\r\nswitching industries or took different kinds of temp work may also want to hide\r\ntheir career history using a functional resume. This format, however, isn\u2019t\r\njust for those questionable career histories. It\u2019s also suggested for\r\ncandidates overqualified for the position they\u2019re applying for based on their\r\nprevious job title. For instance, a Creative Director finding it hard to land similar employment might apply for a Graphic\r\nDesigner or even an Account Executive position just to get hired. ", "Of course, those are all theories and well-meaning advice\r\ngiven without hard data. There\u2019s no survey or statistic published on the effectiveness\r\nof functional resumes. In reality, functional resumes get thrown out in the\r\nearly stage of the application process. ", "Why? Because recruiters and everyone who reads resumes for a\r\nliving hate it.", "If you're considering using a functional resume, be sure to read the rest of this article first. If you're still convinced a functional resume is for you, here's our tutorial on how to write one:", "I\u2019ve talked to in-house recruiters, corporate headhunters,\r\nhiring managers, and small business owners, and they all have one thing in\r\ncommon: they don\u2019t like functional resumes.

", "When that happens, you run the risk of getting your resume\r\nthrown out just because it\u2019s difficult to read. Someone less qualified than you\r\nmight even make it to the interview list, just because their resume is easier\r\non the eyes. ", "Hiring candidates, whether it\u2019s for entry or mid-level jobs\r\nis fast and furious because each job ad attracts an ", "average of 250 resumes", ". Plus, non-exclusive headhunters are forced to\r\ncompete with other agencies to fill the same roles that just put on added pressure to the headhunters. ", "With all those resumes to review, interviews to schedule and\r\nall the paperwork in between, guess how much time a typical recruiter has to\r\nread a resume? ", "About ", "six seconds", ".\u00a0", "During those six seconds, recruiters work fast to find your:", "Unfortunately, a functional resume hides almost all of that\r\ninformation. Some functional resumes include job titles, some don\u2019t. It\u2019s\r\nimpossible to tell the highest level of responsibility you\u2019ve achieved in\r\na functional resume format because all the bullet-point achievements and skills\r\nnormally in the professional history section are jumbled up together instead of\r\nseparated into different job entries. ", "While it\u2019s true that your abilities are what convinces\r\nemployers to hire you, the fact that it\u2019s hard to establish whether you learned those skills in a job setting makes your candidacy dubious. ", "Recruiters and hiring managers read resumes every day, and\r\nthey\u2019re aware that the functional resume format is commonly used to hide employment gaps. As a\r\nresult, this intentional ambiguity forces them to draw their own conclusions\r\nabout your professional history.", "So whatever you put in the skills section, recruiters will\r\nskip straight to your professional history to figure out what you\u2019re trying to\r\nhide. But often this is just to satisfy their curiosity; they\u2019ve already\r\ndecided they don\u2019t like you as an applicant because you\u2019re hiding something. Some\r\nof them might not even bother doing this\u2014they\u2019ll just move on to the next application.\r\nObviously, this isn\u2019t the effect you\u2019re trying to achieve with your\r\napplication.", "You've got to remember that recruiters aren\u2019t your friends,\r\nalthough they may appear friendly and nice over the phone.

Below is a list of the tactical disadvantages\r\nof this format based on its content and structure. ", "If you've got C++ or Ruby on Rails programming experience, it'll carry more weight if you can link it to a specific job, more so if you\u2019ve\r\nheld that job for a few years. For a recruiter, a skill listed could mean\r\nanything from a book you\u2019ve read to a short seminar you took, both of which can\u2019t\r\nbe equated to an actual job where you get experience from real-world projects\r\nand feedback from developers ahead of you in their career.", "Like Boyer explained, a functional resume takes all your\r\nskills and achievements out of chronological sequence, making it harder for the\r\nrecruiters to decipher your experience\u2019s relevance in today\u2019s market.

You might have been a skilled advertiser five\r\nyears ago, but the market has changed so much since then.", "Functional resumes also don\u2019t show career trajectory, so\r\nrecruiters can\u2019t tell if you\u2019ve moved past the entry-level skills required for\r\nyour job or if you\u2019re just fluffing up your resume with skills you don\u2019t have.", "Some companies and jobs like things to be done a specific\r\nway. Sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re just used to it, other times it\u2019s because\r\nthey've got a software or procedure that requires things to be done that way. ", "For example, some companies might not accept a resume file\r\nand instead ask you to fill out their\r\nonline application form.

You don\u2019t have RA and you\r\ndefinitely don\u2019t know how people it afflicts feel on a daily basis, nor what\r\nemotional distress they endure. You\u2019ve conducted empathy interviews with people who have RA, but so far they have only spoken about difficulties in accessing services. You have observed that it has been difficult for them to speak about how RA make them feel. ", "You decide to use your body as a means of understanding what\r\npeople suffering from RA go through. You tie your hands and feet in a way that\r\nrenders them immobile and even painful to use. You walk from your office to the\r\ncaf\u00e9 down the block. You start finding out that it takes you longer that a\r\nquick five-minute walk. Furthermore, the pain you feel in your bones as you try to\r\nget to the coffee shop makes you stop regularly.\u00a0", "When you get to the coffee\r\nshop, there\u2019s the matter of using your hands. You notice how painful and almost\r\nimpossible it is to take out the wallet from your pocket, to open it, to take\r\nout the money and pay the cashier. You experience the same pain when you pick\r\nup the coffee mug and carry it to the table and even when you pick up the\r\ncoffee and drink it. And when you\u2019re done drinking your coffee, you have to get\r\non your feet and make your way back to the office one painful step at a time. You stop to gather yourself before you begin the walk back to the office. ", "On the office whiteboard that you\u2019ll eventually fill with\r\nsticky notes, you create an ", "empathy map", " where you record first hand\r\nobservations of your simulated experience as a person living with RA.

", "You are engaging in sensory understanding of a particular person in a particular circumstance that is foreign to you. You are getting first hand experience that you would not come close to understanding by just listening and record their insights, needs and motivations.   ", "This experiential exercise gives you the best place to start framing your initial problem question. It will also allow you to ask questions that connect with the user from a place of emotional understanding.  ", "Think of method actors who completely \u201cbecome\u201d another person\r\nand live that other life from when they have committed themselves to the script\r\nuntil the film or play comes to an end. They have to live in character from\r\nmoment to moment. The observations they make, the decisions they make, are of the person whose life they\u2019ve immersed themselves in. ", "You too may at some point be given the project that requires\r\nyour team to create a product for a group of people who have different physical\r\nneeds compared to the average person. And in order to empathize and ask the\r\nright questions you will have to make a decision to experience their lives in\r\nthe same way method actors experience a person they are portraying. ", "It\u2019s important to understand that immersive empathy can also\r\nbe used to find solutions to challenges of your average everyday scenario. ", "Practicing immersive empathy not only takes you beyond a\r\nstate of awareness, it allows you to seek solutions that are emotionally\r\nsatisfactory because you were able to connect with subject from an interior\r\nspace that they live inside every single day.", "It is difficult for people to express their latent needs and desires. They may not have the right language to capture and express them. And when they do have the language, they are not ready to speak about how their situation makes them feel. They don\u2019t want to be misunderstood or feel exposed and vulnerable. ", "When members of Design Thinking team have immersed themselves, and experienced on a sensory level what people they want to design for are experiencing, their insights are sharper. They become attuned to how the people feel, they have a glimpse of their emotional state. As a result they are able to articulate what the users feel and ask questions that makes the users feel understood on an emotional level. This makes the users feel free to share from a place of trust. ", "In the scenario I described at the beginning of this tutorial, IDEO had worked with a healthcare company to help them communicate the products and services that they have. What people would talk about was the access to services. People weren\u2019t ready to go to the emotional place. The teams that worked with the company performed an immersive empathy exercise that involved taping their hands and limbs. They realized how painful it was move, how long it took to get to a particular cafe, the restriction one feels. ", "The immersion exercise made them realize constant pain was depressing. It was something that people they were interviewing experienced. They now had insights as to what was going on beneath the surface. They started asking sufferers about the depression they were dealing with as a result of RA. They understood that it was something that needed to be addressed. The unspoken depression then provides an opportunity to include it in designing of the product, services, and treatment plans.
